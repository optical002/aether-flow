# AetherFlow Game Engine

AetherFlow is a high-performance game engine built on **functional programming** with **ZIO** for concurrency and **ECS** (Entity Component System) for modularity. Inspired by the concept of "Aether," symbolizing purity and space, AetherFlow emphasizes smooth, dynamic interaction and effective management of game systems. It combines the power of **pure effects** and **modular components**, delivering a scalable and fluid architecture for building responsive, concurrent games.
